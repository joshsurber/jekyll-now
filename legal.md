## Privacy Policy

This site collects small amounts of personal information. It uses WordPress, so it keeps the same cookies as any other WP site uses. They are only used to track repeat visitors. My web host also keeps logs of visitors&#8217; IP addresses, which can be easily tied to your approximate location (city and possibly neighborhood) and ISP, and with a court order could be tied to your computer. This is information kept by every site on the internet, however, and if it scares you then you should probably not be online.

If you comment then your email and name (as typed) are stored, though your email will not be visible to anyone else.

## Affiliate Links

Some links on this site are affiliate links. While I do not use actual ads, purchasing items from some of the links I post will result in me getting a cut. I will not allow any compensation of any form to influence how I review or recommend any product, however.

## Email Policy

By sending me email, you agree to the following:

  * I am, by definition, “the intended recipient”.
  * All information in the email is mine to do with as I see fit and make such financial profit, political mileage, or good joke as it lends itself to. In particular, I may quote it where I please.
  * I may take the contents as representing the views of your company.
  * This disclaimer overrides any disclaimer or statement of confidentiality that may be included on your message.
