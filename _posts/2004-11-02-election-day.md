Go vote. Go. Do it. Do it now.

(Preferably for the guy who didn’t lie to Congress and the nation as a whole, telling us that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction to start a war with a country that hadn’t since 1991 killed a single American—covering up his [miserable failure](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html) to capture or kill the guy who orchestrated the attacks of 11SEP01. But it’s your vote.)
