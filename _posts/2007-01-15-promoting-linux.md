Most Linux news sites ([OS News](http://www.osnew.com), [Linux.com](http://linux.com), [NewsForge](http://newsforge.com), etc) run a couple of articles per week on how you can help to promote use of Linux on desktop systems. My simple advice, refuse to do any tech support for people using Windoze, other than installing Linux. Since most tech geeks are their familyâ€™s IT support, if more people refused to help troubleshoot viruses and malware on Windoze the unwashed masses would have little choice other than to either migrate to Linux or put up with Indian tech support hotlines.

Slightly cruel but should be effective.
