I find myself at a political crossroads. I always vote Green Party, because they are the only party whose policies I (most closely to) fully agree with, and they are, in general, far less corrupt. I don&#8217;t want to vote for someone I know that I will hate having in office. But this election I am less sure about whether to follow that. Bush _must_ not win this election; that much has been obvious ever since he wiped his ass with the Constitution (aka signed the Patriot Act into law) but if I vote for who I want to it is one less vote to put Kerry in the lead over Bush. I don&#8217;t care for Kerry. I don&#8217;t want him in office, but desperate times call for desperate measures, right? So should I vote for who I believe in, or follow the lead of every other American and just vote against the person I don&#8217;t want in office?
