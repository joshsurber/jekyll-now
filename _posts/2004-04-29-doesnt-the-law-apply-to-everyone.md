[A 97 year old lady is pissed off because she got arrested](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-04-28-woman-jailed_x.htm). She got pulled over for having an expired registration, and it turned out she had a _six month old_ outstanding warrant for the _same registration_! So the cops take her to jail, but she is convinced she is the victim here. That’s no big deal, most criminals think that. But what troubles me is that _everyone agrees with her_! She received letters of apology from both the mayor and governor, and was given a new registration free! Just because she goes to the media complaining that she was “handcuffed and fingerprinted like a common criminal.” Having been in jail a couple of times, I have news for this lady-criminals don’t get more common that not paying a ticket.

Sorry to rant. That pisses me off and I had to get it off my chest.
