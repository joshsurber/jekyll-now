I am 25 now. Doesnâ€™t seem much different, but I guess I say that every year.

Saw Beth last weekend &#8212; she came by to say happy birthday to Rachel and I (Rach&#8217;s birthday was last Wednesday)

Jennifer and my one year anniversary is coming up at the end of this month. Has it been a year already? We are celebrating at SIx Flags.

Working overnight all week because we have some big audit coming up.

Working at migrating to WordPress (again). I am starting to feel limited by TextPattern. I would still recommend TxP to almost anyone, though.

We were supposed to be moving soon, but it looks like we won&#8217;t after all. Sucks, but I am at least going to insist on moving to a different apartment in this complex.

And now I have to leave for work.
