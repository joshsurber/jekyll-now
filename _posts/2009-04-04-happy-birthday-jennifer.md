Today is [my wife](http://jenna.surber.us)&#8216;s twenty fifth birthday! I am taking a four day weekend from work so I can spend some time with her &#8212; due to my odd work schedule I spend most of my time either at work or asleep. We haven&#8217;t done much together today, as her friend took her out for a birthday lunch/shopping trip she hasn&#8217;t been home, but we are going to do something cool later.
