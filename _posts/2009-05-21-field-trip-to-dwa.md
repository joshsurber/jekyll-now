On Tuesday, Evan&#8217;s grade went on a field trip to the [Dallas World Aquarium](http://dwazoo.com). The wife and I tagged along as chaperones, taking care of a small group of kids. Despite my normal antipathy towards children, we actually had a great deal of fun!

Before we went to the aquarium, we took a side trip to [Linda Spurlock park](http://www.nrhtx.com/dept_parks_lindaspurlock.aspx), where the kids played a while and ate lunch. Then they all boarded a bus and we headed to Dallas. I normally can&#8217;t stand Dallas, and refuse to go there even to see a good show (I do plan on making an exception for when [the Nekromantix](http://nekromantix.com) play with [the Reverend Horton Heat](http://reverendhortonheat.com) on [25 July](http://www.houseofblues.com/tickets/eventdetail.php?eventid=56579)) but was willing to do so to hang out with the wife and kid.

When we got there, we hit a slight snag; parking was $5 and for some reason the parking lot was one of the ones where you have to stuff bills in a box. We rarely if ever carry cash, and this is the first place I have seen in several years where I couldn&#8217;t use plastic. Fortunantally, one of the other parents had some extra money and gave it to us. It would normally be embarrassing to have to even ask, but I refuse to feel like a fool when _they_ are the ones who won&#8217;t take my Visa.

Jennifer took the [camera](http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B000KJQ1DG/ref=nosim/?tag=adaptiveblue-20) I got her for X-Mas, and took several pictures. She created a gallery of her favorites; I just uploaded the [entite mess online](https://goo.gl/photos/ZBFyy1kQDgVzELuu5 "Jenna's photos from Evan's field trip"). Feel free to browse and enjoy.
