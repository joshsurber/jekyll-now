Quite a bit of blood has been shed through the ages over Jerusalem. From the crusades to the current conflict, and the indirect such as the September 11 attacks and even World War II. The solution to the whole thing is so painfully obvious, though, I don’t know why I haven’t ever heard it discussed.

Nuke the Holy Land.

Not out of aggression, mind you. Tell everyone there that we are gonna, help them relocate, give them money, whatever. But after everyone is out (who is willing to leave, at least) drop a big nasty dirty bomb. Or intentionally create a Chernobyl-type meltdown. It doesn&#8217;t matter. Just make sure it is uninhabitable for a long long time.

Because seriously, why would anyone fight over land that they can&#8217;t use anyway?
