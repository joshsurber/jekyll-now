I had to go in for another doctor checkup the other day. At the one I went to about a week ago, I had eaten too soon to the appointment, so they couldn’t take my blood. (I did this on purpose) However, the “good” doctor only gave me an inhaler prescription good for two refills, and I quickly realized that I should go take the needle so I can get more when my asthma kills me.

After the twelve hours of not eating (which meant I was starving through a work shift — they forgot I work overnight) I went in planning to be brave, constantly telling myself that it was no big deal. Which worked fine until I sat down and they pulled out a needle.<!--more-->

I have always known I was afraid of needles, but I never thought it was bad enough to be considered [belonephobic](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Belonephobia). But when I saw the needle, I started hyperventilating worse than I have in my life. They took me in another room to let me lie down; I was doing fine then until they came back at me with the needle… and I started crying.

They suggested that I see the specialist across the hall, and kept pointing out that she had “a chair”. I’m sure that her chair was comfortable, and that someone who chooses a career as a vampire is a lovely person, I told them. They gave me some kind of slip to take to her. I smiled, walked out of the office… and ran all the way to my car.

Today I went in to take some kind of a breathing test they needed me to take at the hospital. It wasn’t much; breath into a tube hard, then soft, then hyperventilate… but then she pulled out a needle. Fortunately she said that if I was hyperventilating the way I was the test she needed to do wouldn’t give accurate results; when I explained to her that I didn’t do needles and that was the only kind of results she could get. she was reasonable; she let me go home.
