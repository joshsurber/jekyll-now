I thought at first that the movie would just be a sequel of <cite>The Nightmare Before Christmas</cite>, which I thought sucked hugely. It was quite good though.

    The main character is betrothed to some girl from a prestigious family without money, while his family has money without prestige. Their marriage is arranged by both families as one of convenience, but he quickly falls for his bride. However, he is a bit inept and has trouble remembering his vows. While practicing them in the forrest, he slips the ring on what he believes is a dead twig, but in fact happens to be the hand of a dead girl. He realized that he loves her, yet is stuck between the worlds of the living and the dead, bound to both by love and obligation.<br /> It was very well done, with much better animation/claymation than <cite>Nightmare</cite> had. The plot seemed slightly thin, but the characters were done well enough to more than make up for that.<br /> Rating:<br /> ★★★★☆
